# PWA Icons

Your app needs icon files to be installable. Here's how to add them:

## What you need:
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixel PNG icon
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixel PNG icon

## How to create them:

### Option 1: Use a free icon generator
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a square image (like the 📚 emoji as a PNG, or your logo)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename them to `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
5. Upload to your GitHub repo

### Option 2: Create manually
1. Create a 512x512 pixel image with:
   - Background: Purple/indigo gradient (#6366f1 to #8b5cf6)
   - Text: "D2D" or "📚" in white, centered
   - Border radius: 20-30% for rounded corners
2. Save as `icon-512.png`
3. Resize to 192x192 and save as `icon-192.png`
4. Upload both to your GitHub repo

## Temporary solution:
For now, the app will work without icons, but browsers won't show an install prompt until you add them.

## Quick fix with emoji:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/books/
2. Download the ZIP
3. Use the 192.png and 512.png files
4. Rename and upload them
